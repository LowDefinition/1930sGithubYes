# Welcome to 1930!

As a general rule, I don't alter a vanilla file unless it has to be altered.  For new ideas, advisors, & high command, for most countries, the file \common\ideas\30generic can be used. Using it allows us to avoid file comparisons on most minor countries when a major version is pushed out by PDX.
