 eng.40.t:0 "Lord votes for Government Proposal"
 eng.40.desc:0 "In a recent vote, a Lord has suprisingly switched sides to vote for a Government proposal.

 eng.44.t:0 "Opposition suffers defeat in the House of Lords"

While technically only one man with one vote, London insiders nonetheless counted him as worth several votes as he was the key to secure several others. \n\nWith the seat most likely going to an avowed critic of [ENG.GetLeader], the Administration will find it a lot harder to secure the necessary votes to pass bills."
